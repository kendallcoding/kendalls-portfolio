    <div #id="about">I am one of the most dedicated people when it comes to my craft. While things may not come easy to me, 
        I will continue to work at it until I get it done. I graduated in 2013 from Southern Utah University with a bachelor's degree in biology.
    I was going to pursue dental school but life had other plans for me. I've been working at UPS for the last year and was ready for a career change. 
Which has let me to developing!</div>
